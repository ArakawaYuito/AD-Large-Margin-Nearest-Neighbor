# Large Margin Nearest Neighbor
Anomaly Detection with Large Margin Nearest Neighbor. Large margin nearest neighbor is a statistical machine learning algorithm for metric learning. It learns a pseudometric designed for k-nearest neighbor classification. The algorithm is based on semidefinite programming, a sub-class of convex optimization.
